### Wazzap ðŸ‘‹

It's fun if this is your hobby and your job innit, it's a :gift: :relaxed:?  
Summary of the last couple of months:  sleep:sleeping: code:computer: eat:hamburger: repeat:repeat:  
Love programming day and night, but ideally in a typechecked language :cop:. I've :pencil::pencil::pencil: a lot of Java but it feels quite rusty and verbose.  
I would prefer âœ¨Kotlinâœ¨ any time.

Looking forward to try some rust soon!
